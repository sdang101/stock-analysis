### Challenge
![All Stocks (2017)](https://github.com/sdang101/stock-analysis/blob/master/All%20Stocks%20(2017).png)

In 2017, all the stocks had a positive return except for TERP (-7.2%) with DQ having the highest return (199.4%).

![All Stocks (2018)](https://github.com/sdang101/stock-analysis/blob/master/All%20Stocks%20(2018).png)

In 2018, all the stocks had a negative return except for ENPH (81.9%) and RUN (84.0%) with the lowest return being DQ (-62.6%).

It seems that from year to year stock returns various immensely from year to year. As we can see, DQ had the highest return in 2017 but the lowest return in 2018.
